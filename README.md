# udemy-snappy-list-builder

The Udemy Snappy List Builder plugin allows those with admin priviledges to add new subscribers to the Subscriber and List custom post types in order to add subscribers and create subscriber lists using names and emails. This info is then stored in the database. 
Subscribers can be added as long as their emails are not already recorded on the system in which case updates can be made to the subscriber but they cannot be added as new again unless they have been removed from the database. 

The code used to create custom list and subscriber post types has been generated by the Custom Post Type UI plugin. It has simply been inserted here to make it easy to use the My Udemy Snappy List Builder plugin without any dependencies.  

Problems:
There are some issues around validation for subscriber entries into the database. The "Post published" notice still pops up when a duplicated email address causes an entry not to be added to the database. 
It also currently still adds an empty entry into the database when atempting to add non unique email address subscribers. 

Additional features that should ideally still be added:
Should allow subscribers to be added on a web page rather than only by admin.
Should allow subscribers and subscriber lists to be imported and exported via CSV files.
